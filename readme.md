This is the landing page for the website ctpaint.us.

It has a field where users can enter their email to sign up for the CtPaint newsletter. The app checks to make sure their email is valid, and submits it to a firebase server.

Written in Elm 0.17, with ports to Coffeescript to communicate with firebase. A little bit of Lodash is used.
